Selected Foundational Research Projects:

- Knowledge Transfer in Continual Learning, Auckland, New Zealand (2022-current). This project aims to investigate mechanisms to encourage knowledge transfer whilst avoiding catastrophic forgetting in supervised continual learning. I am the principal investigator for this project. Parts of this project are funded by: Marsden Fast Start Grant, The Royal Society of New Zealand, and New Staff Research Grant, University of Auckland. Collaborators: Bing Liu, University of Illinois at Chicago, and Patricia Riddle, The University of Auckland.

- Long-Sequence Transformer Architecture, Auckland, New Zealand (2021-current). This project aimed at proposing new transformer architectures tasks that involve long sequences of data. My role involves leading the research team into exploring alternatives, designing experiments and evaluating approaches.
Collaborators: Michael Witbrock, Joshua Bensemann, Alex Peng, Trung Nguyen, Neset Tan, The University of Auckland.

- Deep Learning for GWAS, Auckland, New Zealand (2021-current). This project aimed at applying the latest transformer network architectures to genomics data for predicting the likelihood of gout disease, using both publicly available data and New Zealand data.

- Continual Correction of Errors Using Smart Memory Replay, Auckland, New Zealand (2019-2020). The goal of this project was to investigate and develop a method for smart experience replay for continual learning of a sequence of supervised tasks. This involved co-supervision of an Honours student. Collaborators: Yun Sing Koh, The University of Auckland.

- A Framework for Long-Term Learning Systems, Auckland, New Zealand (2016-2019). The goal of this project was to investigate and develop methods for learning a sequence of supervised tasks using SVM. I was the principal investigator for this project. Collaborators: Patricia Riddle, Yun Sing Koh, The University of Auckland.
