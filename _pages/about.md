I am a Computer Scientist with vast experience exploiting data for science and decision making. I have more than 10 years of professional and research experience in data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence. I have worked with researchers and practitioners during planning and execution of projects in these areas, in a wide variety of domains including social welfare, healthcare, life sciences, justice and insurance. I have worked with both public and private sectors. 

My professional experience is enriched by leadership in foundational research projects in advanced areas such as transfer learning, continual machine learning, large language models and human-algorithm collaboration. I have led groups of data scientists, data architects and machine learning engineers during planning and execution of research and applied projects.
